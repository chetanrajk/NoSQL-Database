# NoSQL-Database

Developed a NoSQL in-memory database to handle massive data collection providing an interactive query mechanism and XML support to persist the database. Implemented template classes to store data in the form of key/value pairs using unordered-map in which value part stores meta-data, real data and relationships to other keys.

To run the project:

--> run compile.bat
--> run run.bat
